Requestor (to chat_manager):

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

coder (to chat_manager):

To determine if a given string `s` containing the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']' is valid based on the rules you provided, you can use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. Here is a Python function that implements such a validation:

```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    # Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    # Define a mapping of closing to opening brackets
    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Iterate through the string characters
    for char in s:
        # If the character is a closing bracket
        if char in bracket_map:
            # Pop the topmost element from the stack if it is not empty
            # If the stack is empty, use a dummy value that won't match
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            
            # If the mapping for the closing bracket doesn't match the popped element
            if bracket_map[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.append(char)
    
    # The stack should be empty at the end for a valid expression
    return not stack

# Example
input_string = "{[]}"
print(isValid(input_string))  # This should return True as the input string is valid
```

In this function, we go through each character of the input string and perform the following:

1. If it is an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack.
2. If it is a closing bracket, we check if the last opening bracket in the stack matches the type (by comparing with the mapping). If it does, we pop the matching opening bracket from the stack; if it does not, the string is invalid, and we return `False`.
3. At the end of the iteration, we check if the stack is empty. An empty stack means that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets in the correct order, and we return `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means that there are unmatched opening brackets, making the string invalid, and we return `False`.
